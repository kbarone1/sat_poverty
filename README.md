# sat_poverty

There are three datasets in this repository:\
\
  <strong>frpm.csv</strong> : California student poverty data found [here](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filessp.asp) \
  <strong>schools.csv</strong> : California school data found [here](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filessp.asp)\
  <strong>satscores.csv</strong> : California student SAT data found [here](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sp/ai/)\
\
There are also two .sql files. Both files illustrate how the percentage of students in CA schools receiving free lunch has a generally inverse relationship with test scores. Generally, the lower the percentage of students receiving free lunch, the higher the test scores, and visa versa.
